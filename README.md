# DAT602-A1

This is the repository for the DAT601 Assignment 1, which include files for C# .NET Winforms and SQL Database queries.

The tasks include:
1. Storyboards and User Stories:
This section was used to showcase the designs of the game interface, include storyboarding, written descriptions and user stories. 
With this, I created detailed digital mockups of each screen of the game and show designs that show how players can use the game (including authentication, gameplay etc.)
User stories were used to describe a functional requirement.

2. Logic Entity Relationship Diagram and Explanation:
This section was used to showcase an ERD using the 'Crow's Foot' notation. As well as this, an explanation of the tables (including their attributes and relationships) was described.
I used 'Visual Paradigm' to create the diagram and used Microsoft Word tables to list the attributes with their descriptions.

3. CRUD Table:
This section was used to showcase a CFRUD table that showed the process of each functionality of the classes.
For each function, I identified if it could utilize either the 'Create', 'Read', 'Update' or 'Delete' operations.

4. Write and Testing DDL SQL
This section included written and tested visuals of each table created for the SQL tables.
I had written the tables using 'MySql Workbench 8.0' and tested them to make sure they have executed as expected

5. C# .NET Application Prototype
This section required me to create a prototype of three screens, 'authentication', 'admin' and 'gameplay'. From this, I also had to accommodate each with their corresponding Data Access Objects.
I used 'Visual Studio 2022' to design the Winforms.
